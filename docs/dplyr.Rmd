This tutorial will provide you the know-how for importing and analysing (tidy) data. We will use the same dataframe to test the most typical dplyr functionlalities. There is no better way to improve your programming skills than trying it yourself.

First of all, we need to load some libraries which are part of the tidyr package:

```{r read data}
library(readr)
```
```{r manipulate data}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(magrittr)
```

## Read data
First of all, we need to import data in R. The most user friendly way to do it is by using the interface provided by RStudio. In the Environment window, click on *Import Dataset* and select *From Text (readr)...*. A window will pop-up and follow th next steps:
- click on *Browse* to selet the text file you want to import,
- select the right delimiter,
- check whether the classes of the columns fit your purpose and in case apply changes,
- change variable name in *code preview* if you prefer to save the data with a different name than filename,
- click on Import
A dataframe is automatically generated.

### Exercise
1. Read `survey_data_spreadsheet_tidy.csv`. Check whether the columns match the following types
  * `date`: `double`
  * `species`: `character`
  * `plot`: `integer`
  * `sex`: `character`
  * `weight_in_g`: `integer`
  * `device_remarks`: `character`
2. save the data into `data`

## Explore data
Before to start manipulate data, it is best practice exploring the imported dataframe in order to check whether everything is corectly imported and to have an idea about the data. R gives us several tools to do it:
- **view(df)** opens the entire dataframe in viewer
- **head(df)** returns the first part of a data frame. It works with several other data types (vectors, tables, ...). Specifiy how many rows to display with parameter `n`: `haed(df, n = )`, default `n = 6`
- **str(df)** displays the internal structure of the dataframe
- **col_names(df)** retrieves the column names
- **nrow(df)** returns the number of rows of the dataframe
- **ncol(df)** return the number of rows of the dataframe
- **mean(vector)** returns the (arithmetic) mean
- **max(vector)** returns the maximum
- **min(vector)** returns the minimum

You can apply `mean()`, `min()` and `max()` to dataframes as well: the functions will return respectively mean, minimum and maximum of esach column. However, in case one or more columns are not numeric, an error occurs. In case one or more `NA` are present in the data, you need to add `na.rm = TRUE` as parameter in the function call!

### Exercise
Test the functions introduced above to our dataframe `data`. In particular:
1. Display column names
```{r}
colnames(data)
```

2. How many columns are there?
```{r}
ncol(data)
```

3. How many rows are there?
```{r}
nrow(data)
```

4. Display the first 10 records
```{r}
head(data, n = 10)
```

5. Display data in viewer
```{r}
View(data)
```

6. Display structure of data
```{r}
str(data)
```

7. What is the mean weight?
```{r}
mean(data$weight_in_g, na.rm = TRUE)
```

8. What is the min weight?
```{r}
min(data$weight_in_g, na.rm = TRUE)
```


## Sort data
Sometimes is very useful to sort your data. The package `dplyr` offers the function `arrange()` to do it. If no columns are specified, the dataframe is sorted by values of the first column (`arrange(df)`). Use `desc()` to sort a variable in descending order.

### Exercise
1. Sort by date in ascending order
```{r sort data by date}
arrange(data)
data <- arrange(data)
```

2. Overwrite `data` with sorted output

```{r sort and overwrite}
arrange(data)
data <- arrange(data)
```

## Select columns and rows
You can select specific columns of dataframe by `select()`. In order to select rows: `filter()`. Only columns/rows where conditions are true are selected. For example, selecting a column:  `select(df, column_name)`. To select everything except a specific column use the minus symbol: `select(df, -column_name)`.

### Exercise
1. Display the column `weight_in_g`
```{r select}
select(data, weight_in_g)
```

2. Display only the records with `weight_in_g > 30`
```{r filter}
filter(data, weight_in_g > 30)
```

3. Select females with `weight_in_g > 30`
```{r filter two conditions}
filter(data, weight_in_g > 30, sex == "F")
```

4. Display only `weight_in_g` of females with `weight_in_g > 30`
```{r select }
females_weight_above_30_all <- filter(data, weight_in_g > 30, sex == "F")
select(females_weight_above_30_all, weight_in_g)
```

5. Save output of (4) as a variable: `females_weight_above_30`
```{r save output}
females_weight_above_30 <- select(females_weight_above_30_all, weight_in_g)
```

6. Select everything from `data` except device_remarks
```{r }
select(data, -device_remark)
```

## Pipes
As you probably noticed, we need to create new (temporary?) variables everytime we want to apply two or more functions. This method has several disadvantages, i.a. messy workspace, higher memory space usage, and higher chance of typos.

An alternative is to wrap (*nest*) functions one within each other, so that the output of a function would be considered the input of the other one. For example, if we have to apply `f1` to a dataframe `df` and `f2` to the output of `f1`, we write: 
```r
f2(f1(df, ...), ...)
```

This way of working with functions is typical of programming and is implemented in many other programming languages. The disadvantage of this approach is readibility: you have to read from right to left! Following our theoretical example, we apply  `f1` to `df` and then `f2`.

Can we avoid deciphering nested function calls, and making excessive use of temporary variables? Since 2014, the answer is yes, thanks to *pipe* operators. The most used one is the *forward pipe*: `%>%`. We can then rewrite the example above by using `%>%`:
```r
df %>% f1(...) %>% f2(...)
```
Easy, isn't?
As Stefan Milton, author of magrittr package, wrote in [this](https://www.r-statistics.com/2014/08/simpler-r-coding-with-pipes-the-present-and-future-of-the-magrittr-package/) blogpost:
> The order in which youâ€™d think of these steps is the same as the order in which they are written, and as the order in which they are executed.

If you want to create a variable based on the output of a series of functions:
```r
df2 <- df %>% f1(...) %>% f2(...)
```
If you want to overwrite the input dataframe, you can use the *compound assignment operator*, `%<>%` which is the composition of a forward `%>%`, and a backward `%<%` pipe:
```r
df %<>% f1(...) %>% f2(...)
```
The backward pipe works like the ypical asignment symbol `<-`

### Exercise
1. Display the column `weight_in_g` with values > 30 using pipes
```{r pipes1}
data %>% select(weight_in_g) %>% filter(weight_in_g > 30)
```

2. Select females with `weight_in_g > 30` using pipes
```{r pipes2}
data %>% filter(sex == "F", weight_in_g > 30)
```
3. Display only weight_in_g of females with weight in g > 30 
```{r pipes3}
data %>% filter(sex == "F", weight_in_g > 30) %>%
  select(weight_in_g)
```

4.  Save output of (3) as a variable: `females_weight_above_30`
```{r pipes4}
females_weight_above_30 <- data %>% filter(sex == "F", weight_in_g > 30) %>% select(weight_in_g)
```

## `distinct()`
The function `distinct()` retains only unique/distinct values of an input vector. If applied to dataframe, it retains only unique/distinct rows.

### Exercises
1. Show the unique sex values
```{r unique sex}
data %>% select(sex) %>% unique()
```

2. Show the unique species values
```{r unique species}
data %>% select(species) %>% unique()
```

## group_by and summarise
Some data analysis tasks aplly the *split-apply-combine paradigm*: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and then combine the results together. For example, you have a dataframe `df` with the prices of the items bought during your last shopping. You labelled them by `category` (food, clothes, toys, other), so that `df` looks like this:

| item     | category | price |

| sweather | clothes  | 74    |
| apples   | fruit    |  3    |
| ball     | toys     | 23    |
| trousers | clothes  | 92    |
| t-shirt  | clothes  | 25    |
| peers    | fruit    |  5    |

You would like to calculate the sum for each category of items. We can do it via `%>%` and two functions from dplyr library: `group_by()` and `summarise()`:
```r
df %>% group_by(category) %>% summarise(sum = sum(price))
```

`group_by` actually doesn't modify the data contained in the dataframe, but adds an internal grouping to the dataframe, which is visible if you run:
```r
class(df%>% group_by(col_name))
```
which results in `"grouped_df" "tbl_df" "tbl" "data.frame"`. 

If you want to count the number of rows with each unique value of a column variable, you can use the function `count` instead of `summarise`:
```r
df %>% group_by(col_name) %>% count()
```
or even more compact:
```r
df %>% count(col_name)
```

### Exercise
1. Count records per sex
```{r}
data %>% count(sex)
```

2. Show mean weight per sex
```{r group_by & summarise()}
data %>% filter(!is.na(weight_in_g)) %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% summarise(sum = sum(weight_in_g))
```

3. Show mean weight per sex and species
```{r summarise mean}
data %>% filter(!is.na(weight_in_g)) %>% 
  group_by(sex, species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight_in_g))
```

4. Show min, max, mean weight per sex and species and save output as `weight_per_species_sex`
```{r multiple summarise}
weight_per_species_sex <- data %>% filter(!is.na(weight_in_g)) %>% 
  group_by(sex, species) %>% 
  summarise(min_weight = min(weight_in_g),
            max_weight = max(weight_in_g),
            mean_weight = mean(weight_in_g))
weight_per_species_sex
```

##  Reshpaing: spread and gather
This two functions provide opposite functionalities. While `spread()` *spreads* rows into columns,  `gather()` *gathers* columns into rows. An example can be found in these two images from [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html#reshaping_with_gather_and_spread):

![spread](./static/images/spread_data_R.png)
![gather](./static/images/gather_data_R.png)
Notice that  `spread()` and `gather()` aren't dplyr functions but come from the tidyr library.

### Exercises
1. Spread `weight_per_species_sex` to key on  `sex` and values from `mean_weight` and save output as `weight_per_species_sex_spread`
```{r}
weight_per_species_sex_spread <- weight_per_species_sex %>% 
  spread(key = sex, value = mean_weight)
weight_per_species_sex_spread
```

2. Gather back the data and save output as `weight_per_species_sex_gather`. Is `weight_per_species_sex_gather` equal to `weight_per_species_sex`?
```{r}
weight_per_species_sex_gather <- weight_per_species_sex_spread %>%
  gather(sex, mean_weight, "F", "M", na.rm = TRUE, convert = TRUE)
weight_per_species_sex_gather
```

## rename and mutate

Sometimes you need to rename one or more columns. You can do it using function `rename()`:
```r
df %>% rename(new_colname = old_colname)
```

Another typical data analysis task is to create new columns based on the values of existing ones, like converting units or calculating the ratio of values in two columns. We can use the function `mutate()`:
```r
df %<>% mutate(new_column = ...)
```
or you can create a new variable via assignment symbol `->` if you prefer to not modify original dataframe:
```r
new_df <- df %>% mutate(new_column = )
```

You can also use `mutate()` to change the values in a column without creating a new one:
```r
df %<>% mutate(column = ...)
```

### Exercises
1. Rename column `weight_in_g` of `data` to `weight` and overwrite `data`
```{r rename weight}
data %<>% rename(weight =  weight_in_g)
colnames(data)
```

2. Replace `weight` values with values in kg
```{r weight in kg}
data %<>% mutate(weight = weight/ 1000)
data %>% mutate(weight = weight/ 1000)
```

3. Add column `country` with value `US`
```{r add country}
data %>% mutate(country = "US")
```

4. Add column `parsed_date` using function `Date()`
```{r parse date}
data %>% mutate(parse_date = as.Date(date))
```

```{r}
data %<>% mutate(parse_date = as.Date(date))
head(data)
```
