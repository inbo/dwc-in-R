Hi! This workshop material was developed for the [Biodiversity Data Management workshop](http://odnature.naturalsciences.be/safred/workshops) at the 2018 _Safeguarding Biodiversity Data for the Future_ conference. Its main focus is to teach how to standardize biodiversity data to Darwin Core using R, but in order to do that, we also introduce a number of practices and tools:

* Good enough practices in data management
* Tidy data
* Introduction to Darwin Core
* Introduction to dplyr
* Standardizing data to Darwin Core with R
